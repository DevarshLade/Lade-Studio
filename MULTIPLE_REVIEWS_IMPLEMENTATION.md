# Multiple Reviews Implementation

## Overview
Updated the review system to allow users to write multiple reviews per product, with a maximum limit of 10 reviews per user per product.

## Key Changes

### 1. API Layer Updates (`src/lib/api/reviews.ts`)

#### Updated Functions:
- **`canUserReviewProduct()`**: Now checks for 10 review limit instead of preventing duplicate reviews
- **`getUserReviewsForProduct()`**: New function returning array of user's reviews for a product
- **`getUserReviewCount()`**: New function returning review count and remaining reviews

#### New Functions:
```typescript
// Get multiple reviews for a user
export async function getUserReviewsForProduct(productId: string): Promise<{ 
  data: Review[] | null; 
  error: Error | null 
}>

// Get review count and remaining slots
export async function getUserReviewCount(productId: string): Promise<{ 
  data: { count: number; remaining: number } | null; 
  error: Error | null 
}>
```

### 2. UI Component Updates (`src/app/product/[slug]/page.tsx`)

#### ProductReviews Component Changes:
- **Multiple Review Display**: Shows all user reviews with individual edit buttons
- **Review Counter**: Displays "Your Reviews (X/10)" with remaining count
- **Progressive UI**: Different states based on review count:
  - No reviews: Show add review form
  - 1-9 reviews: Show existing reviews + add another form
  - 10 reviews: Show limit reached message with edit-only options

#### New UI Features:
1. **Review Summary Section**: Shows user's existing reviews in a dedicated area
2. **Remaining Count Display**: "Add Another Review (X remaining)"
3. **Individual Edit Buttons**: Each user review has its own edit button
4. **Limit Reached State**: Clear messaging when 10 review limit is reached

## User Experience Flow

### First Time User:
1. User can write their first review (if eligible based on purchase history)
2. Form shows standard review submission interface

### User with Existing Reviews (1-9):
1. Displays "Your Reviews (X/10)" section showing all existing reviews
2. Each review shows rating, date, comment, and edit button
3. Below existing reviews, shows "Add Another Review (X remaining)" form
4. User can add additional reviews up to the 10 review limit

### User at Limit (10 reviews):
1. Shows "Review Limit Reached" message
2. Displays all existing reviews with edit buttons
3. No option to add new reviews
4. Users can only edit existing reviews

## Technical Implementation

### State Management:
```typescript
const [userReviews, setUserReviews] = useState<Review[]>([]);
const [reviewCount, setReviewCount] = useState({ count: 0, remaining: 10 });
const [currentEditReview, setCurrentEditReview] = useState<Review | null>(null);
```

### Review Limit Logic:
- **API Validation**: `canUserReviewProduct()` returns false when user has 10+ reviews
- **UI Display**: Different form states based on review count
- **Counter Updates**: Real-time updates when reviews are added/edited

### Edit Functionality:
- Each review has individual edit capability
- Edit dialog pre-fills with selected review data
- Updates reflect immediately in both user reviews section and main reviews list

## Security & Validation

### Maintained Security Features:
- ✅ Purchase verification (users must have bought and received the product)
- ✅ Authentication requirement
- ✅ Review ownership verification for editing
- ✅ Rate limiting (10 reviews max per user per product)

### API-Level Protection:
- Review submission blocked when limit reached
- Edit operations require ownership verification
- All existing RLS policies remain in effect

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Engagement**: Users can provide multiple perspectives over time
2. **Detailed Feedback**: Multiple reviews allow for different aspects/experiences
3. **Reasonable Limits**: 10 review cap prevents spam while allowing meaningful contributions
4. **Improved UX**: Clear counter and progressive disclosure of options
5. **Maintained Security**: All existing security measures preserved

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Review limit enforcement
- Multiple review display and management
- Edit functionality for individual reviews
- Counter updates and remaining review tracking
- Proper error handling and user feedback

Users can now write up to 10 reviews per product while maintaining all existing security and validation requirements.
