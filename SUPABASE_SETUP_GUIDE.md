# Supabase Integration Setup Guide

## üéâ Congratulations! 
Your Lade Studio e-commerce website has been successfully integrated with Supabase. Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

## üìã Prerequisites Completed
‚úÖ Supabase client installed (`@supabase/supabase-js`)
‚úÖ Environment variables file created (`.env.local`)
‚úÖ Supabase client configuration created
‚úÖ TypeScript types updated for database schema
‚úÖ Data access layer (DAL) functions created
‚úÖ Pages updated to use Supabase data
‚úÖ Checkout integration with order creation
‚úÖ Database seeding script ready

## üîß Next Steps (Required for Full Functionality)

### 1. Set up your Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Note down your Project URL and API Key from Settings > API
3. Run the SQL schema from `src/sql/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Update your `.env.local` file with your actual Supabase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

### 3. Seed Your Database (Optional)
Run one of these commands to populate your database with sample data:
```bash
npm run db:seed    # Add sample products and reviews
npm run db:clear   # Clear all data
npm run db:reset   # Clear and re-seed
```

### 4. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up proper security:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE order_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow public read access to products and reviews
CREATE POLICY "Public can view products" ON products FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public can view reviews" ON reviews FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Allow public to insert reviews
CREATE POLICY "Public can insert reviews" ON reviews FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow public to insert orders and order items (for checkout)
CREATE POLICY "Public can insert orders" ON orders FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public can insert order items" ON order_items FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow users to view their own orders by phone number
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own orders" ON orders FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own order items" ON order_items FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### 5. Configure Razorpay (Optional)
If you want to use Razorpay for payments:
1. Sign up at [razorpay.com](https://razorpay.com)
2. Get your Key ID from the Dashboard
3. Add to `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your-razorpay-key-id
```

## üß™ Testing Your Integration

### Test Database Connection
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check browser console for any Supabase connection errors

### Test Product Loading
1. Navigate to `/products` page
2. Products should load from Supabase (empty if not seeded)
3. Try filtering by category

### Test Product Details
1. Click on any product (if seeded)
2. Product details should load from Supabase
3. Try adding a review (should save to database)

### Test Checkout Flow
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout page
3. Fill out the form and try placing an order
4. Check your Supabase dashboard to see if order was created
