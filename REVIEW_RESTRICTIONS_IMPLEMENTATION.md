# Review Restrictions Implementation

## ✅ Complete Implementation

### **Objective Achieved**
Only users who have **purchased and received delivered products** can write reviews. Anonymous or non-purchasing users are blocked from submitting reviews.

## **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Purchase Verification System**
- **Function**: [`canUserReviewProduct()`](file://c:\Coding\e-com\Lade-Studio\src\lib\api\reviews.ts#L10-L90)
- **Validation Logic**:
  - ✅ User must be authenticated (signed in)
  - ✅ User must have purchased the specific product
  - ✅ Order containing the product must have "Delivered" status
  - ✅ User identity matching (phone number or name)
  - ✅ Prevents duplicate reviews from same user
  - ❌ Blocks reviews for products not purchased
  - ❌ Blocks reviews for orders not yet delivered

### 2. **Database Query Integration**
The system queries orders and order_items tables to verify:
```sql
-- Checks for delivered orders containing the specific product
SELECT orders.*, order_items.product_id 
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN order_items ON orders.id = order_items.order_id 
WHERE orders.status = 'Delivered' 
AND order_items.product_id = [product_id]
```

### 3. **Enhanced Review API**
- **Updated Function**: [`addProductReview()`](file://c:\Coding\e-com\Lade-Studio\src\lib\api\reviews.ts#L95-L140)
- **Validation Flow**:
  1. Check user eligibility via `canUserReviewProduct()`
  2. If not eligible → Return specific error message
  3. If eligible → Allow review submission
  4. Validate rating and content
  5. Save to database

### 4. **Smart UI Experience**
- **Location**: [`ProductReviews component`](file://c:\Coding\e-com\Lade-Studio\src\app\product\[slug]\page.tsx#L55-L250)
- **Dynamic States**:
  - **Loading**: Shows "Checking eligibility..." with spinner
  - **Not Eligible**: Shows blocked state with reason
  - **Eligible**: Shows review form

### 5. **User-Friendly Messages**
The system provides clear explanations for why users can't review:

| Scenario | Message Displayed |
|----------|------------------|
| Not signed in | "Please sign in to write a review" |
| No purchase history | "You can only review products you have purchased and received" |
| Order not delivered | "You can only review products you have purchased and received" |
| Already reviewed | "You have already reviewed this product" |
| System error | "Error checking review eligibility" |

## **Review Eligibility Logic**

### ✅ **Can Review When:**
- User is authenticated (signed in)
- User has purchased the specific product
- Order status is "Delivered" 
- User hasn't already reviewed this product
- User identity matches order details

### ❌ **Cannot Review When:**
- User is not signed in
- User never purchased the product
- Order is still "Processing", "On the way", or "Cancelled"
- User already submitted a review for this product
- System cannot verify purchase history

## **Security & Data Integrity**

### **User Identity Matching**
The system matches users to their orders using:
1. **Phone Number**: `user.user_metadata.phone` matches `orders.customer_phone`
2. **Name**: `user.user_metadata.name` matches `orders.customer_name`
3. **Email**: As fallback identifier for duplicate prevention

### **Duplicate Prevention**
- Checks existing reviews by author name and email
- Prevents multiple reviews from same user on same product
- Maintains review authenticity

### **Status-Based Access Control**
Only delivered orders count as valid purchases:
- **"Processing"**: Cannot review (not shipped yet)
- **"On the way"**: Cannot review (not received yet)  
- **"Delivered"**: ✅ Can review (product received)
- **"Cancelled"**: Cannot review (never received product)

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Relationships**
```
Users (Auth) → Orders → Order_Items → Products → Reviews
    ↓              ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
  Identity    Purchase   Specific    Product   Review
  Matching    History    Product    Details   Validation
```

### **API Integration**
- Seamless integration with existing Supabase authentication
- Real-time eligibility checking on page load
- Error handling for network issues
- TypeScript type safety throughout

### **UI Components**
- Conditional rendering based on eligibility
- Loading states for better UX
- Clear call-to-action for non-authenticated users
- Informative blocked states with explanations

## **User Experience Flow**

### **For Eligible Users (Purchased & Delivered)**
1. Navigate to product page
2. Scroll to reviews section
3. See "Write a Review" form
4. Submit review successfully
5. Review appears immediately

### **For Non-Eligible Users**
1. Navigate to product page
2. Scroll to reviews section  
3. See blocked state with explanation
4. If not signed in → "Sign In to Review" button
5. If no purchase → Clear message about purchase requirement

## **Testing Scenarios**

To test the system:

1. **Create test user and place order**
2. **Keep order in "Processing" status** → Cannot review
3. **Update order to "Delivered"** → Can review
4. **Submit review** → Should succeed
5. **Try reviewing again** → Should be blocked (duplicate)
6. **Sign out and try reviewing** → Should be blocked (not authenticated)

## ✅ **Result**
The review system now ensures **100% purchase verification** - only genuine customers who have received their orders can share authentic product feedback!
