# Order Cancellation Implementation

## ✅ Complete Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
- **Added `cancellation_reason` field** to orders table
- Updated TypeScript types to include the new field
- SQL script: `ADD_CANCELLATION_REASON_TO_ORDERS.sql`

### API Functions
- **`cancelOrder(orderId, reason)`** - Updates order status to 'Cancelled' and stores reason
- Located in `src/lib/api/orders.ts`
- Proper error handling and validation

### React Components

#### CancelOrderDialog Component
- **Location**: `src/components/order/CancelOrderDialog.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Modal dialog with pre-defined cancellation reasons
  - Custom reason input when "Other" is selected
  - Form validation and loading states
  - Toast notifications for success/error feedback

#### Updated OrdersTab
- **Location**: `src/app/my-account/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Cancel button only shows for orders in 'Processing' status
  - Hidden for 'On the way', 'Delivered', and 'Cancelled' orders
  - Integrated with CancelOrderDialog component
  - Real-time order list refresh after cancellation

### Business Logic

#### Cancel Button Visibility Rules
```typescript
const canCancelOrder = (status: string) => {
    return status?.toLowerCase() === 'processing';
};
```

- **Show Cancel Button**: Only for 'Processing' orders
- **Hide Cancel Button**: For 'On the way', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled' orders

#### Cancellation Reasons
Pre-defined options:
1. "Changed my mind about the purchase"
2. "Found a better price elsewhere"
3. "Ordered by mistake"
4. "Shipping will take too long"
5. "Product doesn't meet my expectations"
6. "Financial constraints"
7. "Other" (with custom text input)

### User Experience Flow

1. **User clicks Cancel button** (only visible for Processing orders)
2. **Dialog opens** asking "Why are you cancelling this order?"
3. **User selects reason** from radio button list
4. **If "Other" selected**: Custom textarea appears for detailed reason
5. **Form validation**: Ensures reason is provided and valid
6. **Confirmation**: User clicks "Cancel Order" button
7. **API call**: Updates order status and stores reason in database
8. **Success feedback**: Toast notification confirms cancellation
9. **UI refresh**: Order list updates to show 'Cancelled' status
10. **Cancel button disappears** for the cancelled order

### Status Color Coding
- **Processing**: Yellow background (can be cancelled)
- **On the way**: Purple background (cannot be cancelled)
- **Delivered**: Green background (cannot be cancelled)
- **Cancelled**: Red background (already cancelled)

### Database Storage
When order is cancelled:
- `status` field updated to 'Cancelled'
- `cancellation_reason` field stores the user's reason
- Original order data preserved for record keeping

### Error Handling
- Network errors display user-friendly messages
- Validation prevents empty reasons
- Loading states prevent double-submission
- Failed cancellations show error toast notifications

## ✅ Ready for Use

The order cancellation system is fully implemented and ready for users to:
1. View their orders in My Account
2. Cancel orders that are still in 'Processing' status
3. Provide reasons for cancellation
4. See updated order status immediately

The system ensures data integrity while providing a smooth user experience for order management.
